Cusror tabbing—fun, cursor prompting—not fun

Line of inquiry
- What would it be like if chat gpt has no chat bot? how would it change the way we interact with it?
- What are the non-verbal signal/behaviour would help us to get info about the user without natural language?
- What if the input was past behaviour? (spotify playlist/cursor tab/tiktok algorithm)
- What might be the role of friction play into an interaction like this?

How do we design ai for AI Skeptic?
